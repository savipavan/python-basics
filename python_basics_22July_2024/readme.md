Day 1 = Basic Python

Python is a general purpose language it is also known as scientist language or utilitarian
python is very simple, high level programming language

c,c++,java, c# = low-level programming language
control over all the aspects of the language - memory management, garbage collection etc...

in high level programming language - less control over memory management, type assignment, garbage collection
- the less you do, more language has to perform at run time

that's why python is bit slow in performance in comparision of C++, Java
but this slow can over come by
- Scale up infra, host our workload on cloud

being a simple, python conde is very concise, very expressive, requires less time and efforts and less line of code

RAD : Rapid application development - you application goes to market, production very fast

python code is 3-5 times shorter than Java and C#

Python is an interpreted language and not compiled language

being an interpreted language -- entire language stack would be available at runtime

Python has very poplular modules, libraries
- NumPy = scientific and mathematical calculation
- SciPy = Scientific calculation
- Pandas = data science
- pyTorch = ML
- TensorFlow = AI
- Flask = Web APIs
- DJango = Web Application in MVC architecture

Python is fully object oriented programming language.
it supports all 4 pillers of 
- OOP -- Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance
- No Curly brackets {} to define a functional block or a code block
- ; semi colon is not mandatory

Source code in .py extension
Source code will convert to byte code in runtime and the file will conver to .pyc file
.pyc code will give it to PVM

when we install python, we get minimum 2 things
1. Python Interpreter - CPython(Default interpreter)
                      - JPython - developed using Java

2. Python modules -- Random, Date, Time, Decimal, File, CSV, PDF, RE, CPickle

What can be done using Python:
- System programming
- GUI programming
- Internet scripting
- Component integration
- DB Programming
- Gaming, Image processing
- XML and Robotics
- Data Science and AI + ML

Google's search enginer optimization algo is developed using python
Youtube video sharing service is developed using Python
Scandisk is using Python for hardware testing of pendrive
NYSE is using python for daily calculations
NASA is also using Python for further calculation

in this 2 days
- Python Data Types
- Strings in details
- Python Operators
- Control Flow statements -- if..elif, do..while
- Iterators : for
- User defined functions(custom)
- Lambda expressions
- Python Data collections, data structors : tuples, list, set, dictionary
- File I/O
- Regular expressions
- Built in python modules
- Exception handling
- List comprehension
- OOP in python
